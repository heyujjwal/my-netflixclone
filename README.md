# my-netflixclone

Introduction
The objective of this internship project was to create a Netflix clone landing page with specific features, including a sliding image carousel, and a watch trailer feature when clicking on the video. The project aimed to mimic the appearance and functionality of the Netflix landing page, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for visitors.
Task Description
1. Landing Page Design
The first task was to design and implement the landing page for the Netflix clone. The layout and appearance of the original Netflix landing page were used as a reference for this task. The following elements were included:
A header with the Netflix logo and navigation menu.
A sliding image carousel showcasing popular movies and TV shows.
A "Watch Trailer" feature on clicking on each item in the carousel.



2. Sliding Image Carousel
The sliding image carousel was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view a set of images related to popular movies and TV shows. The carousel automatically cycles through the images, and users can also navigate manually using the left and right arrows.






3. Watch Trailer Feature
For each movie or TV show displayed in the carousel, a "Watch Trailer" feature was added. When users click on video, a youtube trailer  opens up, allowing them to watch the trailer of the selected movie or show. The video player utilizes react trailer npm library video capabilities to ensure cross-browser compatibility.






4. Adding various movie category sections ::
For each section I have added various sections and data of API was fetched accordingly.
Sections included:

1. Netflix originals 
2. Trending Now
3. Top-Rated
4. Action-Movies
5. Horror-movies
6. Romance-movies
7. Comedy-movies
8. Documentaries

The following technologies were used to complete the project:
HTML5 and CSS3 for building the page layout and styling.
JavaScript and  for implementing the sliding image carousel and video player functionalities.
React framework was used .
Also for fetching data and videos TMDB movie API was used.
Challenges Faced
During the course of the internship, several challenges were encountered:
Responsive Design: Ensuring that the landing page appeared and functioned correctly across different devices and screen sizes required careful attention to responsive design principles.
Video Integration: Implementing the watch trailer feature with a smooth and efficient video player was more complex than initially anticipated. Ensuring compatibility across various browsers and platforms required thorough testing.
Handling loads of data via TMDB API and ensuring that website should not crash and should display each and every video data properly and website should not lag too.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the internship project was successful in creating a Netflix clone landing page with essential features, including a sliding image carousel, sign-in/sign-up functionality using Auth0,TMDB movieAPI and a watch trailer feature. The project provided valuable experience in front-end web development, user authentication, and API integration. Additionally, it improved skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and react expertise and its various npm libraries feature.
Overall, this internship was a great opportunity to learn and apply modern web development techniques, and I am grateful for the guidance and support provided throughout the process. The completed Netflix clone landing page serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my ability to develop user-friendly and visually appealing web applications.
